        <Text opacity='0.8' fontSize={{ sm: '14px', lg: '16px' }}>
          With a simple tweet to gauge the presence of the web3 community,
          Monica's expectations were surpassed as engagement flooded in,
          revealing an undeniable need for connection and IRL community for web3
          builders.

          In June 2022, The Chain was born, assembling the best local builders
          and forward-thinkers in the web3 space through hosting monthly dinners
          and keeping the local web3 community up-to-date by launching a texting
          community that shares weekly texts about upcoming events, and a
          celebration of community wins.
